## Clarifications 

### Task 1 : 

- Bonus: Optimize for faster page load time
- Additional improvements to the design are welcomed you do not have to stick to the design mentioned strictly.
- Technologies to be used: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, ShadCN

### Task 2 :
- Add an item in the header to toggle between light mode and dark mode
- The implementation should not be naive, you will be judged on how efficiently you implement this feature

### Task 3 :
- The UI should look good for all screen sizes (including mobile 320px to 4k screens)
- The responsive design is not strict as long as it looks good on mobile, The design is left to the discretion of the person submitting the assignment

### Task 4 :
- Add a working carousel for the first section (The main heading "Lessons and insights from 8 years")
- On sliding the whole section should move like a carousel (The title, description, and image for the other 2 slides are left to your discretion)

### Task 5 :
- Add a "count-up animation" to the section that says "Helping a local business reinvent itself"
- when this section loads the number should start from 0 and reach its desired end value in Figma
- The animation should be smooth
